# Custom-3DS-Assets
I will try to collect as much as information and place it here. Maybe something can be done with Matrix or IRC or via an app on GitHub pages but that is no priority atm. If you want contact me at Discord (derberg#7221) and I will answer questions and may add you to a group where I will add everybody that 
asks for it..
