# Custom-3DS-Assets
Since the owner of the Discord server decided to turn a useful Discord server for resources about 3DS system apps modification into a steam card trading server after 
he was offline 
for over a year.. I will try to collect as much as information and place it here. There may be new servers as replacements (on Discord or Matrix or IRC or via an app on GitHub pages 
if possible..) but that is no priority atm. If you want contact me at Discord (derberg#7221) and I will answer questions and may add you to a group where I will add everybody that 
asks for it..
